            <p>You will need to setup a LAN environment. There are two main programs you can use: RAdmin VPN (Windows only) and ZeroTier. Once you have setup the LAN environment (the process depends on the program), the host must go on the menu and click on "Change your server's IP" and copy and paste their own IP (The IP inside the VPN, not their real IP!). Note that this is done WITHOUT the port (:24105), only the IP. Then for the others to join they must go on "Change the client IP" and paste the same IP used by the host.</p>
            <p><b>WARNING:</b> Make sure only to invite friends. The server is full of vulnerabilities for hackers!</p>
